This plugin is perfect for you, if you procrastinate using Youtube and want to spend less time watching videos. It adds a simple reminder before every video that reminds you of this very fact. If you still want to watch the video, e.g. because it's a music video you listen to while reading, you have to wait for 40s before you can watch it.

Right now, the plugin supports Firefox and Firefox for Android
