# What is this repo about?
I want to watch less time watching youtube, but all the website blockers that I used didn't help me to break the habit longterm.
This plugin is my attempt to do just that.

In a previous version, I added a timer before every video to make me conscious of the Youtube spiral I was in. This shortened its time, but I still watched more videos than intended.

The current version adds a dialogue with the different use cases I identified how I use YouTube and requires different actions for each one.

Right now, the plugin supports Firefox and Firefox for Android
